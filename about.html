                    <h1>Why President Pat?</h1>
                    <h2>This story begins on a Tuesday 37 years ago...</h2>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        the day Pat was born. Fun Fact, he was only born with one name like Madonna or Cher. Pat was born ready to be president of the United States. He had all the qualifications. For instance he had an American flag tatooed on him while still in his mother's womb! And his first words were "These colors don't run." Pat is like as American as you can fucking get, you know?
                        When he came out the Dr. said "I hope this young man runs for President one day so I can vote for him. Also I'm envious at how large his penis is. It's very large even proportionally to an adult male, but not like in a gross unhealthy way. Just like all big and sexy."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pat is a registered Repubmocrat. He was disillusioned between the choice between Trump and Biden, and like a cop who's wife was murdered by a gang of thugs in the 80's, he decided to take matters into his own hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pat is the guy for the job, he is a super smart, muscular, father, writer, athlete, rich guy, big penis, and did I mention he has a really big penis? This is a website not made by him so legally it must be true. <br /> He is a real Pat-of-all-trades hahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahaha. Please God laugh.
                        He has his finger on the pulse! Is the American dream dead? No it's just sleeping. Pat is checking to make sure it's alive.
